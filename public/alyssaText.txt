This is my fianc√© Alyssa. I love her a whole lot. All of the guys I know who are single have thought of asking her out at least 3 times.
I make jokes all the time because that's kinda what I do, but all jokes aside, she's a keeper.
She asked me one time how I don't get jealous when she brings up that other guys have asked her out and such...
...I just said that it's funny, but the truth is, every time I see that a guy tried to ask her out,
I really love it, because I just think, "Dang, what are the odds that I got to end up with her?"
So every time she mentions some guy, it reminds me how incredibly blessed I am to be the one who got to strike gold.
