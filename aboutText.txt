You have three different options for creating a habit:
1. Fast   
        Fasts are temporary, but 100% consistent until the end day
        (ex. I will fast from using Instagram until 30 days)
2. Blitz
        Blitz's are just the opposite of fasts, meaning we focus on doing one thing consistently until the end goal
        (ex. for the next 14 days, I will run a mile every day, excluding Sunday)
3. New Habit
        Pick one new thing that you want to be a part of your life every day!
        Be it big or small, the only requirement is that it's consistent!
        (ex. I will make my bed every day)
