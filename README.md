# ConsistAndSee
## Elevator Pitch
Aren't you tired of setting a new goal that you're so excited about, only to see it fall flat in a matter of days? Aren't you tired of social media soaking up so much of your time as you mindlessly scroll? What you need is ConsistAndSee, an app designed to track your most important daily goals in an easy-to-manage setup for you, and share them with your friends, to increase your accountability, and support received from your community. This is the social media that will lead you to a productive life as we all celebrate consistency, and as you champion YOUR goals, you will also champion yourself. Develop the habits you wish your life to _consist_ of, _and see_ the results!
