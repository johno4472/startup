# ConsistAndSee
## Elevator Pitch
Aren't you tired of setting a new goal that you're so excited about, only to see it fall flat in a matter of days? Aren't you tired of social media soaking up so much of your time as you mindlessly scroll? What you need is ConsistAndSee, an app designed to track your most important daily goals in an easy-to-manage setup for you, and share them with your friends, to increase your accountability, and support received from your community. This is the social media that will lead you to a productive life as we all celebrate consistency, and as you champion YOUR goals, you will also champion yourself. Develop the habits you wish your life to _consist_ of, _and see_ the results!

## HTML
Here are some of the things that I did for the startup HTML
-Created 4 different sub pages - create, report, review, and about
-create.html lets you input a new habit you want to begin tracking, then submit it. The submit button sends you to review.html
-report.html lets you mark the habits you have completed, one by one, then submit them. Hitting the submit button will send you to review.html
-review.html shows with a bar how close you are to completing your fast or blitz, or how many days you have been consistent with a habit
-about.html gives an explanation of the format of the website, and how things work logistically; it inserts a text taken from the file aboutText.html
-index.html takes your username, then sends you to report.html when you submit it

## CSS Deliverable
Properly styled CSS
30% Header, footer, and main content body - You can see this on every page of my website
20% Navigation elements - Navigation elements were really helpful in the header, to help my page menu display on a separate row from the WebTitle and username
10% Responsive to window resizing - You can play around with that and see that I've incorporated flex
20% Application elements - All of the web page buttons are interactive, so you can jump around the site and explore! I will make the buttons prettier in the future.
10% Application text content - There is text on every page, but you can see the majority of it on about.html
10% Application images - You can see the image I have inserted on my about.html page, and I've added a web icon
