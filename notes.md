Here is where I'll put my notes for the semester!
## GitHub
I learned that GitHub is a SUPER useful tool! I want to be much better at coding from the terminal, so I will spend more time pushing and pulling from my repository.
## AWS Server Setup
- Here's my elastic public IP Address: 52.201.130.123 
- This is how I ssh into my server:  ssh -i [key pair file with path] ubuntu@[ip address]
## Startup HTML
- I already made my startup HTML when I did this class for last semester (before I withdrew)... time to revisit it, tweak it, and see what I learn!
